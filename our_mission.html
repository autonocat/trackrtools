        <h2 style="color: #6EA4CA">About The Tracker Mission</h2>
        <p>Of course...this isn't a tool just for people of i-banking, PE, or VC - it's <span style="color:#6EA4CA">a tool for recruits of all stages and types.</span> By using the history of banking recruiting as a framework for all industries, we believe that if you follow the steps in the tracker, you are set to make it happen and land more offers!Tracker is here to reduce the organizational issues of recruiting.</p>

        <p>There are so many enterprise tools for recruiters out there to manage their applicant pool (HireVue, Handshake, WorkDay). It's time that the <span style="color:#6EA4CA">recruits get empowerment</span> and that is what tracker is here to do.</p>

        <p>Our goal is to give users the tools to manage their recruiting flow, get technical interview practice and <span style="color:#6EA4CA">land more offers.</span> Join us & see what opportunities lay ahead.</p>

        <p>There is so much noise in the recruiting process..countless job positing sites, recruiters who seem to never get back to you, a lack of industry knowledge to help you with technical questions..we get that. <span style="color:#6EA4CA">Getting that first internship</span> is one of the most important parts in your College (or sometimes High School) career. One opportuntiy leads to another, and you're on a roll from there. </p>
        <p>Tracker is here to be that suite of products that the market seems to be ignoring. We're tarting off small, with a note taking template, and a tracker. But in the days of 'Uber for X', we want to be <span style="color:#6EA4CA">the Amazon of recruiting.</span> That's going down the full stack - everything from Finance, to Engineering, to Government, to Grad School Applications. We want to reinvent recruiting from a two sided perspective, giving applicants transparency of deadlines for offers, so you don't waste your time with prospects who have already left the gate.</p> <p>Eventually, you'll be able to apply to jobs on our platform, gain technical interview practice, network with recruiters and go from no job, to job offer in hand. But we need to walk before we can run, and run before we can fly.</p>
